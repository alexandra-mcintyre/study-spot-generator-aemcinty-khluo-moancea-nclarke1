## OVERVIEW
This code is an implementation of a jog path finding algorithm that helps individuals plan jogging routes based on their current location and preferred distance. We use a combination of APIs from OpenStreetMap API and OpenRouteService, backend with MongoDB, and a custom algorithm that generates a path with the required inputs

## FEATURES
Customization: Allows users to customize their jogging route based on factors like distance, current location, their own preference.
Interactive: Provides an clean, interactive user interface for entering preferences and viewing the recommended route.
Geographic Data: Utilizes geographic data to generate routes
Optimization: Attempts to find the most optimal route based on user preferences.
